# Project Description
An individual project to develop a fun 2D game in java. This project was assigned during my first year of my undergrad studies.

# Takeaways from this project
* Learning and applying appropiate event classes and listener interfaces, for instance:
    1. KeyEvents: provide a shortcut to visit the main menu as well as more importantly navigate the rabbit around the level 
    2. CollisionEvent: detect if the avatar has collected a carrot (score points accordingly) or been hit by an enemy (decrease life count if they have been hit by the enemy and remove the enemy from the map)
    3. ActionListener: for instance if the user clicks the mute button, the in-game audio will be muted
* Learning how to use Java Swing in order to create GUI like the main menu
* Learning and applying class inheritance 
* Enhancing my general object oriented programming skills
