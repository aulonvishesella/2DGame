# Project Description
An individual project to develop a fun 2D game. This project was assigned during first year bootcamp during my undergraduate studies. 

# What I learnt
* Applying KeyEvents in order to allow the user to navigate the avatar
* Utilising collision evnts and listeners in order to detect if the avatar has collected a carrot or been hit by an enemy
** score points if they have collected a carrot
** decrease life count if they have been hit by the enemy and remove the enemy from the map
* Applying action events such as muting the audio when a mute button is clicked
* Using Swing in order to create GUI for the user such as a main menu panel, game control panel and so on
