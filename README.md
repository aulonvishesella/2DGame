# Project Description
An individual project to develop a fun 2D game. This project was assigned during my first year of my undergrad studies. 

# What I learnt
* Applying KeyEvents in order to allow the user to navigate the avatar based on the key they selected
* Utilising collision evnts and listeners in order to detect if the avatar has collected a carrot (score points accordingly) or been hit by an enemy (decrease life count if they have been hit by the enemy and remove the enemy from the map)
* Applying action events such as muting the audio when a mute button is clicked
* Using Swing to create GUI like the main menu panel
