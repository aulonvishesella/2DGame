# Project Description
An individual project to develop a fun 2D game in java. This project was assigned during my first year of my undergrad studies.

# Takeaways from this project
* Learning and applying appropiate event classes and listener interfaces, more specifically
    1. ss
* Understanding how to use KeyEvents. For the game, it was to provide a shortcut to visit the main menu as well as more importantly navigate the rabbit around the level 
* Utilising collision evnts and listeners in order to detect if the avatar has collected a carrot (score points accordingly) or been hit by an enemy (decrease life count if they have been hit by the enemy and remove the enemy from the map)
* Learning how to use Java Swing in order to create GUI like the main menu
* Learning and applying class inheritance 
* Enhancing my general object oriented programming skills
